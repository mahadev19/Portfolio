## 🚀 How to run locally

You can open the site directly in your browser by double-clicking `index.html`.

Or serve it using Python's simple HTTP server (recommended if the page fetches local assets using fetch/XHR):

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## ✍️ How to customize

1. Edit `index.html` to update your name, bio, projects, and contact details.
2. Replace images in the `assets/` (or `images/`) folder.
3. Update styles in the CSS file(s) if present.

## 📸 Add a demo (optional)

If you deploy the site (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.), add a **Live Demo** link here:

**Live Demo:** `https://your-username.github.io/Portfolio/`

Replace the URL above with your actual hosted URL.
